[iSee](http://isee.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/) allows the user to experience, use and be entertained with the machine learning and natural language generation technology.

## Natural Language Generation (NLG)

The power of NLG allows present data regarding a photo to be transformed into comprehensive sentences constructed from keywords in such a way that can be read and understood by any human.

## Social Media Integration

With iSee's social media integration, you can submit all photos and pertinent descriptive information to most social media platforms at the tap of a button. Supported platforms include Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, to name just a few.

## Object Detection

Object detection using the latest technology by Google (ML Kit) and Firebase allows for submitted photos to be read and understood by AI components so that accurate descriptions regarding the photo content can be generated.
