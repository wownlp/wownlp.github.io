The UOW NLP group conducts research in natural language processing, with the goal of making computers understand and use human language effectively. We develop novel algorithms, design new frameworks and investigate theoretical foundations to tackle challenging problems in language understanding, drawing on techniques like deep neural networks and reinforcement learning. Our work aims to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence while also enabling strides in practical text processing applications that can have a broad impact on various real world problems. Our recent efforts have focused on question answering, dialogue systems, language grounding, knowledge representation & reasoning, representation learning and algorithms for learning from weak supervision.
